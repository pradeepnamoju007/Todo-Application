# Todo Application

This is a simple Todo Application built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, which are saved in the browser's local storage to persist even after the browser is closed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing tasks to keep your list up-to-date.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Local Storage:** All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive using Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
